# Readme

It seems Internet search engines are so biased towards MSM, that there's room for a search engine biased against them.

Thanks to Brave Goggles, [**it's here!**](https://search.brave.com/goggles?goggles_id=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Ftaoeffect%2Fdiscard-msm%2Fmaster%2Fdiscard-msm.goggle)

### Contributing

MSM sites are completely removed, not just deranked, so that small organic websites can leak through the noise.

If there's an MSM-influenced website you'd like to add (from any part of the world), feel free to send a PR and I'll consider it.

It's also easy to fork and [create your own!](https://github.com/brave/goggles-quickstart)
